```

### Agent Task Description

**Agent:** Campaign Monitor

**Objective:**
- Scan the 'briefs/' directory for campaign brief JSON files
- Use filesystem_monitor tool with action='scan' to detect briefs
- For each brief found:
  1. Analyze the campaign requirements (products, regions, target audience)
  2. Determine if this is a new campaign or an update to existing campaign
  3. Assess the priority and complexity of the generation task
  4. Provide recommendations for generation approach
- Return a structured analysis of all detected campaigns with priorities

### Tool Execution 1: Filesystem Monitor

**Agent Thought:** I need to scan the 'briefs/' directory for campaign brief JSON files to analyze their requirements and determine the necessary actions for generation.

**Tool Used:** filesystem_monitor

**Input:**
```json
{
  "action": "scan",
  "path": "briefs/"
}
```

**Output:**
```json

```

### Agent Task Description

**Agent:** Generation Coordinator

**Objective:**
Based on the campaign analysis, coordinate generation tasks:
1. For new high-priority campaigns, trigger generation using: `creatimation generate campaign briefs/[filename].json --dry-run`
2. For modified campaigns, determine what needs regeneration
3. Execute actual creatimation CLI commands with real brief filenames
4. Monitor generation progress and handle any immediate errors

**Key Requirements:**
- Use real brief filenames from the detected campaigns
- Get actual filenames from the Campaign Monitor Agent's scan results
- Always start with --dry-run for safety

### Tool Execution 1: Scan for Campaign Briefs

**Agent Thought:** I need to start by identifying the actual brief filenames for the new high-priority campaigns.

**Tool Used:** filesystem_monitor

**Input:**
```json
{
  "action": "scan",
  "path": "campaign briefs/"
}
```

**Output:** (Same 3 campaigns detected as before)

### Tool Execution 2: Dry-Run Generation - CleanWaveSpring2025

**Command Executed:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && ./creatimation generate campaign briefs/CleanWaveSpring2025.json --dry-run
```

**Tool Used:** creatimation_cli

**Result:** ✅ Success

**Output Summary:**

### Tool Execution 3: Dry-Run Generation - CleanWaveSpring2026

**Agent Thought:** The dry run for CleanWaveSpring2025.json was successful. Now, I will proceed to trigger the generation for the second high-priority campaign CleanWaveSpring2026.json using the --dry-run option as well.

**Command Executed:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && ./creatimation generate campaign briefs/CleanWaveSpring2026.json --dry-run
```

**Tool Used:** creatimation_cli

**Result:** ✅ Success

   - Provided generation recommendations

2. **Generation Coordinator Agent** (Task 2):
   - Identified high-priority campaigns (cleanwave_spring_2025 and cleanwave_spring_2026)
   - Executed dry-run generations for both high-priority campaigns
   - Validated generation parameters
   - Confirmed 36 creatives would be generated for each campaign
   - Successfully completed pre-flight checks

**Next Steps:**
- Remove `--dry-run` flag to execute actual generation
- Monitor generation progress and output
- Handle any errors or failures during generation
