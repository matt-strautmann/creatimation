## The Problem

If you've ever worked at a CPG company, you know the creative production pain:
- Manual creation takes 2-3 days per campaign and costs $500-2000
- Inconsistent products across variants (each creative looks different)
- Regional campaigns need different messaging but same product
- Creative teams spend time on repetitive work instead of strategy

## The Solution

This pipeline generates 36 regional variants in ~6 minutes for $1.48. The key insight: generate each product once, then compose it into different scenes. Same CleanWave bottle across all 36 variants, different backgrounds and messaging.

**What you get:**
- 2 regions (US, EMEA) with localized messaging
- 3 aspect ratios (1x1, 9x16, 16x9)
- 3 variants per ratio (base, hero, lifestyle)
- 2 products = 36 total creatives
- 100% product consistency across all variants

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python3 -r requirements.txt

# 2. Get FREE Google API key (500/day limit)
# Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# 3. Check your setup
./creatimation config show

# 4. Generate some creatives (uses 3 parallel workers by default)
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/CleanWaveSpring2025.json

# Optional: control parallelization
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/CleanWaveSpring2025.json --parallel 5  # Faster

# 5. See what happened
./creatimation analytics summary --recent
```

That's it. You should have 36 creatives in the `output/` folder.

## How It Works

### Two-Step Workflow
1. **Generate products once**: Clean product shots with neutral backgrounds
2. **Compose into scenes**: Fuse products into different backgrounds with regional messaging

This ensures 100% consistent products across all variants. The same CleanWave bottle appears in every creative, just in different scenes and with different messaging.

### Smart Caching
Products get cached in `cache/products/` and reused across campaigns. When you run a new campaign with the same products, you save the product generation step (about 5% cost savings per campaign).

### Regional Localization
Same product, different messaging:
- US: "Try CleanWave Today"
- EMEA: "Choose CleanWave"

The system supports up to 4 regions (US, LATAM, APAC, EMEA) for global campaigns.

## What You Get

Your output will look like this:

```
output/cleanwave-original-liquid-detergent/hero-product/
├── us/
│   ├── 1x1/
│   │   ├── base.jpg
│   │   ├── hero.jpg
│   │   └── lifestyle.jpg
│   ├── 9x16/
│   └── 16x9/
└── emea/
    └── [same structure]
```

Each creative has the same product but different:
- Background scenes (kitchen vs laundry room)
- Color palettes (base brand colors vs accent colors)
- Typography styles
- Regional messaging

## Performance

Real numbers from the CleanWave example campaign (with parallelization):
- **Time**: ~3 minutes for 36 creatives with parallel generation (3 workers) vs 2-3 days manual
- **Cost**: $1.48 per campaign vs $500-2000 traditional
- **Consistency**: 100% identical products across all variants
- **API efficiency**: 51% cheaper per image than DALL-E ($0.039 vs $0.08)
- **Parallelization**: 2.5-3x speedup with conservative 3 workers (configurable 1-8+)

The analytics plugin tracks all this automatically, so you can see exactly how much time and money you're saving.

## CLI Commands

The `creatimation` CLI is designed to be simple but powerful:

```bash
# Generate creatives
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/your-campaign.json

# Add a brand guide for consistent styling
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/your-campaign.json --brand-guide brand-guides/your-brand.yml

# Preview without generating (no API cost)
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/your-campaign.json --dry-run

# Fast simulation for demos (mock images, ~3 seconds)
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/your-campaign.json --simulate

# Control parallelization (default: 3 workers)
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/your-campaign.json --parallel 5
./creatimation generate campaign briefs/your-campaign.json --parallel 1  # Sequential

# Check your results
./creatimation analytics summary --recent

# Manage cache
./creatimation cache stats
./creatimation cache clear

# Configuration
./creatimation config show      # See current settings
./creatimation config validate  # Check everything works
```

## Campaign Briefs

Campaigns are defined in JSON files. Here's the **minimum required brief**:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "test",
  "products": [
    {"name": "Product A"}
  ],
  "creative_requirements": {
    "variant_types": ["base"]
  }
}
```

This generates: 1 product × 1 region (US default) × 3 aspect ratios (default: 1x1, 9x16, 16x9) × 1 variant = **3 creatives**

**Full-featured example:**

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "spring_refresh_2025",
  "products": ["CleanWave Original Liquid Detergent"],
  "target_regions": ["US", "EMEA"],
  "target_audience": "Busy families with children",
  "campaign_message": "Spring Into Freshness",
  "creative_requirements": {
    "aspect_ratios": ["1x1", "16x9", "9x16"],
    "variant_types": ["base", "hero", "lifestyle"]
  },
  "regional_adaptations": {
    "US": {
      "call_to_action": "Try CleanWave Today"
    },
    "EMEA": {
      "call_to_action": "Choose CleanWave"
    }
  }
}
```

The system automatically generates appropriate scenes, applies brand guidelines, and creates regional variants. You can customize everything - aspect ratios, variant types, color palettes, text treatments - but the defaults work well.

## Development Story

This started as a simple DALL-E integration but evolved significantly:

### Why We Switched from DALL-E to Gemini

**DALL-E Limitations:**
- Required 5 steps per creative (generate product → remove background → generate scene → composite → add text)
- 16 seconds per creative
- $0.08 per creative
- Complex pipeline with 8 components

**Gemini Breakthrough:**
- One API call per creative (product + scene + text in one)
- 3.2 seconds per creative sequential
- ~1.2 seconds per creative with 3 parallel workers (2.7x faster)
- $0.039 per creative (51% cheaper)

But the real breakthrough was realizing we could use Gemini's multi-image composition to implement the two-step workflow. Generate products once, then fuse them into different scenes.

### Architecture Evolution

**Version 1 (DALL-E)**: 8 components, 1500+ lines of code
- Enhanced Brief Loader
- Image Generator (DALL-E)
- Background Remover (AI model)
- Creative Compositor (PIL)
- Image Processor (text overlays)
- Layout Intelligence
- Output Manager
- Cache Manager

**Version 2 (Gemini)**: 4 components
- Enhanced Brief Loader
- Gemini Image Generator (unified)
- Output Manager
- Cache Manager

The simpler architecture is easier to maintain and much faster.

## Advanced Features
